### Hello World

This is my very first blog posts. I wrote here just to complain how much time I wasted for using this Jekyll pages. I download ruby and downgrade to ruby@2.7. I edit the default PATH for ruby in `ï½ž/.zshrc` so it can be called. I also encountered issues like `bundler add webrick`. Very frustrating.
